\section{Introduction}

Visualization of high-dimensional data is hard.
In the field of topological data analysis, Mapper~\cite{mapper} is one popular method used for data visualization.

In this report we provide a simple yet fast implementation of Mapper in Python that works on 3D point clouds.

We describe the Mapper algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:alg}.
We provide details of our implementation in Section~\ref{sec:impl}.
We report results of running our implementation on several examples in Section~\ref{sec:res}.
Final remarks can then be found in Section~\ref{sec:concl}.

\section{Algorithm}\label{sec:alg}

Input to the Mapper algorithm is finite point cloud $X \subset \mathbb{R}^3$.
We demonstrate how the algorithm works on an example of torus whose point cloud is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:torus-points}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{torus-point-cloud}
    \caption{Point cloud of torus.}
    \label{fig:torus-points}
\end{figure}

The algorithm first applies filter function $f: X \to I$ where $I \subset \mathbb{R}$, mapping each point to real space.
Filter function can be arbitrary and its choice usually depends on the input data.
Commonly used filter functions are
\begin{itemize}
    \item specific coordinate, e.g., $y$ coordinate $f((x, y, z)) = y$,
    \item distance from point $\mathbf{p}$, i.e., $f(\mathbf{x}) = \lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p} \rVert_2$, where origin is usually used as $\mathbf{p}$.
\end{itemize}
Applying filter function to our torus example is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:torus-filter}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\columnwidth]{torus-y-coor}
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\columnwidth]{torus-distance-from-origin}
    \caption{Different filter functions applied to our torus example.
        Coordinate $y$ is used on the left and euclidean distance from origin is used on the right.
        Value of the filter function is illustrated using color range.}
    \label{fig:torus-filter}
\end{figure}

We continue by splitting interval $I$ into overlapping bins.
Formally, we take $\mathcal{U} = \{ U_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in A}$ finite covering of $I$.
Usually, uniform covering is used.
Then, it is enough to specify number of bins and percentage of overlap.
Two covers for our torus example are demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:torus-cover}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{torus-partition-4-25}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{torus-partition-4-05}
    \caption{Different covers of the torus example.
        We use 4 bins with 25~\% overlap in the top row and 5~\% overlap in the bottom row.
        We also color vertices by their original filter values.}
    \label{fig:torus-cover}
\end{figure}

We then perform clustering of each interval in the cover. Formally, we cluster
points $f^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ for each $\alpha \in A$. Clustering method can be
again arbitrary chosen and its parameters must be tweaked in order to obtain
good results in later stages of the algorithm. Commonly used clustering schemes
include agglomerative clustering (where we can choose for example single or
average linkage), K\nobreakdash-Means clustering and ToMATo~\cite{tomato}. Clustering for our
torus example is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:torus-cluster}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{torus-clustering}
    \caption{Agglomerative clustering with average linkage applied to our torus example.
        Each cluster's center is represented by bigger red dot.}
    \label{fig:torus-cluster}
\end{figure}

Output of the Mapper algorithm is graph $G=(V,E)$ whose vertices $V$ are
clusters from $f^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ for each $\alpha \in A$ and
$$
    \forall u, v \in V, u \neq v: (u, v) \in E \Leftrightarrow u \cap v \neq \emptyset \mbox{,}
$$
i.e., there is an edge between clusters if there is nonempty intersection between them (which happens thanks to overlaps in $\mathcal{U}$).
Resulting Mapper graph for our torus example is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:torus-mapper}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[align=c, width=0.4\columnwidth]{torus-graph-3d}
    \includegraphics[align=c, width=0.4\columnwidth]{torus-graph-2d}
    \caption{Mapper graph of our torus example.
        The same graph is depicted in 3D space on the left and in plane on the right.
        In 3D space, nodes are positioned at their corresponding cluster centers.
        We also color nodes by their corresponding filter values.}
    \label{fig:torus-mapper}
\end{figure}

Finally, we treat the resulting Mapper graph as simplicial complex and compute its persistent homology.
We need filtration to compute persistent homology and we have two obvious approaches for computing filtration from the Mapper graph:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform Rips filtration on the graph in 3D space.
    \item Start with empty filtration.
          Add vertices to the filtration incrementally for increasing filter values.
          Formally, add vertex $v$ to filtration at $f(v)$.
          Add edge as soon as both of its vertices are added, i.e., add edge $(u, v)$ at $\max\,\{ f(u), f(v) \}$.
\end{enumerate}
Persistence diagrams of both approaches applied to our torus example are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:torus-persistence}.
These diagrams report one component and one cycle which is in line with our expectations for torus.

    \caption{Persistence barcodes and diagrams of our torus example computed using Rips filtration (in the top row) and filter-function-based filtration (in the bottom row).}
    \label{fig:torus-persistence}
\end{figure}

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:impl}

We implement the Mapper algorithm as a Python library.
It contains all steps of the algorithm described in Section~\ref{sec:alg} and also code necessary to plot the corresponding figures and diagrams.
We also include Python scripts for running our implementation on examples presented in Section~\ref{sec:res} and a few more.

We implement most of the algorithm ourselves, using NumPy~\cite{numpy} for computations and Matplotlib~\cite{matplotlib} and Networkx~\cite{networkx} for plotting.
However, we use Gudhi~\cite{gudhi} implementation of ToMATo clustering and persistent homology computation and scikit-learn~\cite{scikit} implementation of other clustering schemes.

Our implementation includes basic filter functions (chosen coordinate, distance
from point), uniform cover (with number of bins and overlap parameters) and
aforementioned clustering schemes (our own clustering class serves as proxy for other libraries). Thanks to
flexible modular architecture, more filter functions, cover methods and
clustering schemes can be implemented and incorporated into our Mapper library
easily.

We designed our API to be easily comprehensible for people using scikit-learn libraries by following scikit-learn's API style~\cite{scikitAPI}.

All code is available online at \url{https://github.com/janarez/mapper}.
The repository contains documentation including instructions for using the library and running examples.

\section{Results}\label{sec:res}

We run our Mapper algorithm on a point cloud of human hand consisting of almost thirteen thousand vertices (Figure~\ref{fig:hand}).
We use $y$ coordinate filter function (Figure~\ref{fig:hand-points}), five bins with 25~\% overlap and ToMATo clustering (Figure~\ref{fig:hand-cluster}).
The hand is clearly visible in the resulting graph and its five fingers are well separated with the thumb starting earlier than the other four fingers (Figures~\ref{fig:hand-space} and~\ref{fig:hand-plane}).

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Results of running our Mapper algorithm on a point cloud of hand.}
    \label{fig:hand}
\end{figure}

We also run our Mapper algorithm on two spirals with noise (Figure~\ref{fig:spirals}).
We use $x$ coordinate filter function (Figure~\ref{fig:spirals-points}), seven bins with 4~\% overlap and ToMATo clustering (Figure~\ref{fig:spirals-cluster}).
The two spirals are well separated (Figure~\ref{fig:spirals-plane}) and clearly visible in the resulting graph (Figure~\ref{fig:spirals-space}).

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Results of running our Mapper algorithm on a point cloud of two spirals with noise.}
    \label{fig:spirals}
\end{figure}

Next, we run our Mapper algorithm on a chair point cloud
(Figure~\ref{fig:chair}). We use $y$ coordinate filter function
(Figure~\ref{fig:chair-points}) and set number of bins to 8 with 5~\% overlap.
Again we prefer ToMATo clustering (Figure~\ref{fig:chair-cluster}). The four
legs and the backrest are clearly visible (Figure~\ref{fig:chair-plane}). The
3D embedded graph especially nicely resembles a chair (Figure~\ref{fig:chair-space}).

In Figure~\ref{fig:chair-persistence} we show the persistence barcode from the
filter-function-based filtration of the resulting simplicial complex from the
chair example. We observe the four components at the start corresponding to four
chair legs. They then merge into single component as we approach the chair seat.
In the end a single cycle appears thanks to the backrest.

    \caption{Persistence barcode of chair example using filter-function-based filtration.}
    \label{fig:chair-persistence}
\end{figure}

We finally run our Mapper algorithm on complex point cloud of an ant consisting
of thirteen thousand vertices (Figure~\ref{fig:ant}). As filter function, we use
distance from point $(60, 80, 60)$ lying inside the ant's body
(Figure~\ref{fig:ant-points}). For cover, we use five bins with 5~\% overlap and
ToMATo clustering (Figure~\ref{fig:ant-cluster}). In the resulting graph, we can
see the ant (Figure~\ref{fig:ant-space}), its six legs, tail and two antennae protruding from its head
(Figure~\ref{fig:ant-plane}).

    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[c]{0.3\columnwidth}

\end{figure}

More of our experiments and examples can be found in our code repository described in Section~\ref{sec:impl}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

We implemented Mapper algorithm including persistence homology computation and demonstrated it on several examples.
Our implementation was able to process even large 3D point clouds in negligible time.

We included implementation of several filter functions and clustering schemes.
However, we only implemented uniform cover and leave other ways of covering as
possible future work. Similarly, our library is extensible with more filter
functions and clustering schemes. Finally, we only support 3D point clouds,
although that is mainly limitation of our plotting code, the Mapper algorithm
itself is general and multi-dimensional point cloud support could be added
easily.
